## Current Work Focus

### Large Blue Typewriter Code Effect Implementation
**Status**: COMPLETED âœ…  
**Objective**: Replaced 3 separate typewriter effects with one large code block covering most of the screen, and reduced distracting hologram effects.

**Current Task**: Successfully implemented large-scale blue typewriter animation with complete Unity NetworkBehaviour class.

## Recent Changes

### Large Single Code Block Implementation (Completed âœ…)
- âœ… **Unified Code Block**: Replaced 3 separate small typewriter areas with one comprehensive code block
- âœ… **Full Screen Coverage**: Code now spans `top-16 left-8 right-8 bottom-16` (covers most of hero section)
- âœ… **Complete NetworkBehaviour**: 50+ lines of realistic Unity multiplayer code
- âœ… **Improved Readability**: Increased font size to 1rem, line height to 1.6
- âœ… **Reduced Distractions**: Removed hologram effects from main title

### Hologram Effect Optimization (Completed âœ…)
- âœ… **Removed Title Effects**: Eliminated `neon-flicker hologram-enhanced` and `cyberpunk-glow-anim hologram` from "Unity and .NET" title
- âœ… **Reduced Intensity**: Decreased text-shadow layers from 4 to 2
- âœ… **Gentler Animation**: Increased hologram flicker cycle to 4s from 3s
- âœ… **Higher Base Opacity**: Improved from 0.9 to 0.95 for better visibility
- âœ… **Minimal Movement**: Reduced transform displacement to (-1px, 0px)

### Advanced Code Content (Completed âœ…)
**NetworkBehaviour PlayerController Features:**
- Network multiplayer functionality with Unity Netcode
- Complete player movement system with physics
- Ground detection using Raycast
- ServerRpc and ClientRpc implementations
- Proper Unity component lifecycle (Start, Update)
- SerializeField attributes for inspector exposure
- Input handling for movement and jumping
- Professional C# code structure and patterns

### Performance & Visual Improvements (Completed âœ…)
- âœ… **Better Typography**: 1rem font size, 1.6 line height for readability
- âœ… **Subtle Presence**: Reduced opacity to 0.6 for background effect
- âœ… **Slower Animation**: 6s animation cycle for better code reading
- âœ… **Optimized Spacing**: 0.3rem margin between lines
- âœ… **Reduced Matrix Effect**: Blue scanning effect opacity reduced to 0.1

### Files Updated
- âœ… **blog-nextjs/src/app/page.tsx**: 
  - Replaced 3 typewriter divs with single large code block
  - Removed hologram classes from title
  - Added complete NetworkBehaviour implementation
- âœ… **blog-nextjs/src/app/globals.css**:
  - Improved typewriter-code styling (font size, line height, colors)
  - Reduced hologram effect intensity
  - Optimized animation timing
- âœ… **ANIMATION_CHANGES.md**: Updated documentation with new implementation details

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Optimizations
```css
.typewriter-code {
  font-size: 1rem;                    /* Increased from 0.8rem */
  line-height: 1.6;                   /* Increased from 1.4 */
  color: rgba(0, 150, 255, 0.6);      /* Reduced from 0.7 */
  text-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 150, 255, 0.4);  /* Reduced intensity */
  animation: typewriter-glow 4s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
}

.typewriter-line {
  animation: type-line 6s infinite;    /* Increased from 4s */
  margin-bottom: 0.3rem;              /* Increased from 0.2rem */
}
```

### Animation Timing Strategy
- **0.3s intervals**: Between each line for natural typing rhythm
- **19.2s total duration**: Complete class implementation cycle
- **Continuous loop**: Automatic restart for persistent background effect
- **Hardware acceleration**: CSS transforms and opacity for 60fps performance

### Code Educational Value
The typewriter now displays a complete, production-ready Unity NetworkBehaviour:
- **Real-world applicability**: Actual game development patterns
- **Modern Unity practices**: Netcode for GameObjects implementation
- **Professional structure**: Proper C# conventions and organization
- **Learning resource**: Developers can learn from the displayed code

## Next Steps

### Completed Successfully âœ…
1. âœ… **Single Large Code Block** - Covers most of screen area

## Design Impact Summary

### Before Implementation
- 3 separate small code snippets in corners
- Distracting hologram effects on main title
- Small, hard-to-read code examples
- Scattered visual attention

### After Implementation
